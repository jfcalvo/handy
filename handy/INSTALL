To compile handy:

    1. handy uses a small logging library, you must compile it first:
        
        handydir$: cd logging
        handydir$: make

    2. If the logging library has been compiled you can now compile handy:

        handydir$: cd handy
        handydir$: make

       This will compile all the necesaries object files and a dinamic shared
       library called libhandy.so, you must link your code with this library
       to use handy.


The process is the same for Linux and MacOs.

That's it!
